1. Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?

    1. There were significantly more campaigns in "theater" category followed by "music" and "film & video". Also these three categories show higher rate of success comparing to others: technology, publishing, games, food, journalism.

    2. Drilling down to the sub-categories we can see that the majority of the campaigns is in theater/plays with an OK success rate. There are some sub-categories with an outstandingly high success rates, such as rock, documentary, hardware. Also, if filter the chart by countries, one can notice that in non-english speaking countries the "translations" sub-category shows relatively higher numbers than in US or GB as well as in total.

    3. There is a seasonal trend in when to start a campaign at Kickstarter. More camaigns start in the first half of the year and the success is more likely if the campaign starts in Q2. Number of successes visibily drops by the end of the year, especially if the campaign starts in December.

2. What are some limitations of this dataset?

    * 4000 records is a small sample of the total 300,000 projects and we don't know how this sample was taken.

3. What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

    * Normalized within category/sub-category to compare success ratios.
    * Include staff_pick and spotlight columns.
